## üß† Why

- Most actions related to version upgrade do it backwards:
when you push a commit with version change in a specific branch a release is created.

- This action does the opposite: when you create a release the
specified files will get updated with the new version, so you don't forget to update them.

This comes in handy when working with git workflows such as [trunk-base-development](https://trunkbaseddevelopment.com/) or [master-only](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWz-9uyHP4s).

## üöÄ Usage

With the following example after creating a new release with tag `v2.0.1` on branch `release`,
a new commit will appear in that same branch with both `package.json` and `app.yaml` updated
with the version field to `2.0.1`.

```yaml
name: Upgrade Version
on:
  release:
    types: [published]

jobs:
  upgrade-version:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - uses: qxip/action-update-version@v1
        with:
          files: 'package.json, app.yaml'
          version-regexp: '\d+.\d+.\d+'
          repo-token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```

The action will fail if:
- Both `repo-token` and `branch-name` are not supplied
- The tag cannot be found by `octokit`
- The regular expression cannot match the release tag
- You specify a file with unsupported extension

- Supported file extensions: `json`, `yaml` and `yml`. To add one simply submit a PR with a new parser on the `main.ts` file.

## ‚öô Inputs

By supplying the `repo-token` the commit will use the release information: author and branch.

You can change the branch commit target and the commit author if you want.
